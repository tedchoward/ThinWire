# ThinWire(R) Ajax RIA Framework

## Rich Web Applications, Made Simple!

ThinWire is an open source, Java based web application framework that
uses Ajax techniques to give Web Applications the look and feel of
traditional GUI applications.

ThinWire attempts to differentiate itself from the plethora of Ajax 
frameworks by bringing the event-driven programming model of desktop
applications to web programming. The source code of a ThinWire based
application will more closely resemble that of a traditional desktop
GUI application than it will a web application. ThinWire handles all
the web rendering and browser/server communication automatically.
