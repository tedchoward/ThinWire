/**
 * A <code>Container</code> is a <code>Component</code> that maintains a collection of other <code>Component</code>s as a group.
 * Additionally, <code>Container</code> is the foundation of all other container types in the framework such as <code>Panel</code>, <code>Frame</code>,
 * <code>Dialog</code>, <code>TabSheet</code>, etc.  It is worth noting that components within a <code>Container</code>, maintain there
 * X and Y coordinates relative to the <code>Container</code> itself.  Therefore, a <code>Component</code> with an X value of 5 that
 * is placed in a <code>Container</code> with an X value of 10, will actually be positioned at X coordinate 15.
